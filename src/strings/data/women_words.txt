character is intended to portray any person or combination of persons living or dead I was years old and hadn t been to bed with a woman for four years I had no women friends I looked at them as I passed them on the streets or wherever I saw them but I looked at them without yearning and with a sense of futility I masturbated regularly but the idea of having a relationship with a woman even on non sexual terms was beyond my imagination I had a year old daughter born out of wedlock She lived with her mother and I paid child support I had been married years before at the age of That marriage lasted two and one half years My wife divorced me I had been in love only once She had died of acute alcoholism She died at when I was My wife had been years younger than I I believe that she too is dead now although I m not sure She wrote me a long letter each Christmas for years after the divorce I never responded I m not sure when I first saw Lydia Vance It was about years ago and I had just quit a twelve year job as a postal clerk and was trying to be a writer I was terrified and drank more than ever I was attempting my first novel I drank a pint of whiskey and two six packs of beer each night while writing I smoked cheap cigars and typed and drank and listened to classical music on the radio until dawn I set a goal of ten pages a night but I never knew until the next day how many pages I had written I d get up in the morning vomit then walk to the front room and look on the couch to see how many pages were there I always exceeded my ten Sometimes there were pages Of course the work of each night had to be cleaned up or thrown away It took me twenty one nights to write my first novel The owners of the court where I then lived who lived in the back thought I was crazy Each morning when I awakened there would be a large brown paper bag on the porch The contents varied but mostly the bags contained tomatoes radishes oranges green onions cans of soup red onions I drank beer with them every other night until or am The old man would pass out and the old lady and I would hold hands and I d kiss her now and then I always gave her a big one at the door She was terribly wrinkled but she couldn t help that She was Catholic and looked cute when she put on her pink hat and went to church on Sunday morning I think I met Lydia Vance at my first poetry reading It was at a bookstore on Kenmore Ave The Drawbridge Again I was terrified Superior yet terrified When I walked in there was standing room only Peter who ran the store and was living with a black girl had a pile of cash in front of him Shit he said to me if I could always pack them in like this I d have enough money to take another trip to India I walked in and they began applauding As far as poetry readings were concerned I was about to bust my cherry I read minutes then called a break I was still sober and I could feel the eyes staring at me from out of the dark A few people came up and talked to me Then during a lull Lydia Vance walked up I was sitting at a table drinking beer She put both hands on the edge of the table bent over and looked at me She had long brown hair quite long a prominent nose and one eye didn t quite match the other But she projected vitality you knew that she was there I could feel vibrations running between us Some of the vibrations were confused and were not good but they were there She looked at me and I looked back Lydia Vance had on a suede cowgirl jacket with a fringe around the neck Her breasts were good I told her I d like to rip that fringe off your jacket we could begin there Lydia walked off It hadn t worked I never knew what to say to the ladies But she had a behind I watched that beautiful behind as she walked away The seat of her blue jeans cradled it and I watched it as she walked away I finished the second half of the reading and forgot about Lydia just as I forgot about the women I passed on the sidewalks I took my money signed some napkins some pieces of paper then left and drove back home I was still working each night on the first novel I never started writing until pm That was when I used to punch in at the Terminal Annex Post Office It was pm when they arrived Peter and Lydia Vance I opened the door Peter said Look Henry look what I brought you Lydia jumped up on the coffee table Her bluejeans fit tighter than ever She flung her long brown hair from side to side She was insane she was miraculous For the first time I considered the possibility of actually making love to her She began reciting poetry Her own It was very bad Peter tried to stop her No No No rhyming poetry in Henry Chinaski s house Let her go Peter I wanted to watch her buttocks She strode up and down that old coffeetable Then she danced She waved her arms The poetry was terrible the body and the madness weren t Lydia jumped down How d you like it Henry What The poetry Hardly Lydia stood there with her sheets of poetry in her hand Peter grabbed her Let s fuck he said to her Come on let s fuck She pushed him off All right Peter said Then I m leaving So leave I ve got my car Lydia said I can get back to my place Peter ran to the door He stopped and turned All right Chinaski Don t forget what I brought you He slammed the door and was gone Lydia sat down on the couch near the door I sat about a foot away from her I looked at her She looked marvelous I was afraid I reached out and touched her long hair The hair was magic I pulled my hand away Is all that hair really yours I asked I knew it was Yes she said it is I put my hand under her chin and very awkwardly I tried to turn her head toward mine I was not confident in these situations I kissed her lightly Lydia jumped up I ve got to go I m paying a baby sitter Look I said stay I ll pay Just stay a while No I can t she said I ve got to go She walked to the door I followed her She opened the door Then she turned I reached for her one last time She lifted up her face and gave me the tiniest kiss Then she pulled away and put some typed papers in my hand The door closed I sat on the couch with the papers in my hand and listened to her car start The poems were stapled together mimeographed and called HERRRR I read some of them They were interesting full of humor and sexuality but badly written They were by Lydia and her three sisters all so jolly and brave and sexy together I threw the sheets away and I opened my pint of whiskey It was dark outside The radio played mostly Mozart and Brahms and the Bee A day or so later I got a poem in the mail from Lydia It was a long poem and it began Come out old troll Come out of your dark hole old troll Come out into the sunlight with us and Let us put daisies in your hair The poem went on to tell me how good it would feel to dance in the fields with female fawn creatures who would bring me joy and true knowledge I put the letter in a dresser drawer I was awakened the next morning by a knocking on the glass panes of my front door It was am Go away I said It s Lydia All right Wait a minute I put on a shirt and some pants and opened the door Then I ran to the bathroom and vomited I tried to brush my teeth but only vomited again the sweetness of the toothpaste turned my stomach I came out You re sick Lydia said Do you want me to leave Oh no I m all right I always wake up like this Lydia looked good The light came through the curtains and shone on her She had an orange in her hand and was tossing it into the air The orange spun through the sunlit morning I can t stay she said but I want to ask you something Sure I m a sculptress I want to sculpt your head All right You ll have to come to my place I don t have a studio We ll have to do it at my place That won t make you nervous will it No I wrote down her address and instructions how to get there Try to show up by eleven in the morning The kids come home from school in mid afternoon and it s distracting I ll be there at eleven I told her I sat across from Lydia in her breakfast nook Between us was a large mound of clay She began asking questions Are your parents still alive No You like L A It s my favorite city Why do you write about women the way you do Like what You know No I don t Well I think it s a damned shame that a man who writes as well as you do just doesn t know anything about women I didn t answer Damn it What did Lisa do with She began searching the room Oh little girls who run off with their mother s tools Lydia found another one I ll make this one do Hold still now relax but hold still I was facing her She worked at the mound of clay with a wooden tool tipped with a loop of wire She waved the tool at me over the mound of clay I watched her Her eyes looked at me They were large dark brown Even her bad eye the one that didn t quite match the other looked good I looked back Lydia worked Time passed I was in a trance Then she said How about a break Care for a beer Fine Yes When she got up to go to the refrigerator I followed her She got the bottle out and closed the door As she turned I grabbed her around the waist and pulled her to me I put my mouth and body against hers She held the beer bottle out at arm s length with one hand I kissed her I kissed her again Lydia pushed me away All right she said enough We have work to do We sat back down and I drank my beer while Lydia smoked a cigarette the clay between us Then the doorbell rang Lydia got up A fat woman stood there with frantic pleading eyes This is my sister Glendoline Hi Glendoline pulled up a chair and started talking She could talk If she was a sphinx she could have talked if she was a stone she could have talked I wondered when she d get tired and leave Even after I stopped listening it was like being battered with tiny pingpong balls Glendoline had no concept of time or any idea that she might be intruding She talked on and on Listen I said finally when are you going to leave Then a sister act began They began talking to each other They were both standing up waving their arms at each other The voices pitched higher They threatened each other with physical harm At last near the world s end Glendoline did a gigantic twist of torso and flung herself out of the doorway through the large flapbang of the screen door and was gone but still heard ignited and bemoaning down to her apartment in the back of the court Lydia and I walked back to the breakfast nook and sat down She picked up her sculptor s tool Her eyes looked into mine One morning a few days later I entered Lydia s courtyard as she was walking in from the alley She had been over to see her friend Tina who lived in an apartment house on the corner She looked electric that morning much like the first time she had come over with the orange Ooooh she said you ve got on a new shirt It was true I had bought the shirt because I was thinking about her about seeing her I knew that she knew that and was making fun of me yet I didn t mind Lydia unlocked the door and we went inside The clay sat in the center of the breakfast nook table under a wet cloth She pulled the cloth off What do you think Lydia hadn t spared me The scars were there the alcoholic nose the monkey mouth the eyes narrowed to slits and there was the dumb pleased grin of a happy man ridiculous feeling his luck and wondering why She was and I was over I didn t care Yes I said you ve got me down I like it But it looks almost finished I m going to be depressed when it s done There have been some great mornings and afternoons Has it interfered with your writing No I only write after it gets dark I can never write in the day Lydia picked up her modeling tool and looked at me Don t worry I have a lot more work to do I want to get this one right At her first break she got a pint of whiskey out of the refrigerator Ah I said How much she asked holding up a tall water glass Half and half She fixed the drink and I drank it right down I ve heard about you she said Like what About how you throw guys off your front porch That you beat your women Beat my women Yes somebody told me I grabbed Lydia and we went into our longest kiss ever I held her against the edge of the sink and began rubbing my cock against her She pushed me away but I caught her again in the center of the kitchen Lydia s hand reached for mine and pushed it down the front of her jeans and into her panties One fingertip felt the top of her cunt She was wet As I continued to kiss her I worked my finger down into her cunt Then I pulled my hand out broke away got the pint and poured myself another drink I sat back down at the breakfast nook table and Lydia went around to the other side sat down and looked at me Then she began working on the clay again I drank my whiskey slowly Look I said I know your tragedy What I know your tragedy What do you mean Listen I said just forget it I want to know I don t want to hurt your feelings I want to know what the hell you re talking about O K if you give me another drink I ll tell you All right Lydia took my empty glass and gave me half whiskey half water I drank it down again Well she asked Hell you know Know what You ve got a big pussy What It s not uncommon You ve had two children Lydia sat silently working on the clay Then she laid down her tool She walked over to the corner of the kitchen near the back door I watched her bend down and pull her boots off Then she pushed down her jeans and her panties Her cunt was right there looking at me All right you bastard she said I m going to show you you re wrong I took off my shoes pants and shorts I got down on my knees on the linoleum floor and then eased down on top of her stretching out I began to kiss her I hardened quickly and felt myself penetrate her I began to stroke one two three There was a knock on the front door It was a child s knock tiny fists frantic persistent Lydia quickly pushed me off It s Lisa She didn t go to school today She s been over at Lydia jumped up and began pulling her clothes on Get dressed she said to me I got dressed as quickly as I could Lydia went to the door and there was her five year old daughter MOMMY MOMMY I cut my finger I wandered into the front room Lydia had Lisa on her lap Oooo let Mommy see Oooo let Mommy kiss your finger Mommy will make it better MOMMY it hurts I looked at the cut It was almost invisible Look I told Lydia finally I ll see you tomorrow I m sorry she said I know Lisa looked up at me the tears were coming and coming Lisa won t let anything bad happen to her Momma Lydia said I opened the door closed the door and walked to my Mercury Comet I was editing a little magazine at the time The Laxative Approach I had two co editors and we felt that we were printing the best poets of our time Also some of the other kind One of the editors was a foot subnormal high school drop out Kenneth Mulloch black who was supported partly by his mother and partly by his sister The other editor was Sammy Levinson Jewish who lived with his parents and was supported by them The sheets were printed Now we had to collate them and staple them into the covers What you do said Sammy is throw a collating party You serve drinks and a little bullshit and let them do the work I hate parties I said I ll do the inviting said Sammy All right I said and I invited Lydia The night of the party Sammy arrived with the sheets already collated He was a nervous sort with a head tic and he hadn t been able to wait to see his own poems in print He had collated The Laxative Approach all by himself and then stapled the covers on Kenneth Mulloch was not to be found he probably was either in jail or had been committed People arrived I knew very few of them I walked to my landlady s in the back court She came to the door I m having a big party Mrs O Keefe I want you and your husband to come Plenty of beer pretzels and chips Oh my God no What s the matter I ve seen the people going in there Those beards and all that hair and those raggedy ass clothes Bracelets and beads they look like a bunch of communists How can you stand people like that I can t stand those people either Mrs O Keefe We just drink beer and talk It doesn t mean anything You watch them That kind will steal the plumbing She closed the door Lydia arrived late She came through the door like an actress The first thing I noticed was her large cowboy hat with a lavender feather pinned to the side She didn t speak to me but immediately sat down next to a young bookstore clerk and began an intense conversation with him I began drinking more heavily and some of the drive and humor left my conversation The bookstore clerk was a good enough sort trying to be a writer His name was Randy Evans but he was too far into Kafka to accomplish any kind of literary clarity We had published him in The Laxative Approach rather than hurt his feelings and also to get distribution for the magazine through his bookstore I drank my beer and wandered around I walked out on the back porch sat on the stoop in the alley and watched a large black cat trying to get into a garbage can I walked down towards him He leaped off the garbage can as I approached He stood or feet away watching me I took the lid off the garbage can The stench was horrible I puked into the can I dropped the lid on the pavement The cat leaped up stood all four feet together upon the rim of the can He hesitated then brilliant under a half moon he leaped into it all Lydia was still talking to Randy and I noticed that under the table one of her feet was touching one of Randy s I opened another beer Sammy had the crowd laughing I was a little better at it than he was when I wanted to get the crowd laughing but I wasn t very good that night There were or men and two women Lydia and April April was on ATD and fat She was stretched out on the floor After an hour or so she got up and left with Carl a burned out speed freak That left or men and Lydia I found a pint of scotch in the kitchen took it out on the back porch and had a bite now and then The men began leaving gradually as the night went on Even Randy Evans left Finally there was only Sammy Lydia and myself Lydia was talking to Sammy Sammy said some funny things I was able to laugh Then he said he had to go Please don t go Sammy said Lydia Let the kid go I said Yeah I gotta go said Sammy After Sammy left Lydia said You didn t have to drive him away Sammy s funny Sammy s really funny You hurt his feelings But I want to talk to you alone Lydia I enjoy your friends I don t get to meet all kinds of people the way you do I like people I don t I know you don t But I do People come to see you Maybe if they didn t come to see you you d like them better No the less I see them the better I like them You hurt Sammy s feelings Oh shit he s gone home to his mother You re jealous you re insecure You think I want to go to bed with every man I talk to No I don t Listen how about a little drink I got up and mixed her one Lydia lit a long cigarette and sipped at her drink You sure look good in that hat I said That purple feather is something It s my father s hat Won t he miss it He s dead I pulled Lydia over to the couch and gave her a long kiss She told me about her father He had died and left all sisters a bit of money That had enabled them to be independent and had enabled Lydia to divorce her husband She also told me she d had some kind of breakdown and spent time in a madhouse I kissed her again Look I said let s lay down on the bed I m tired To my surprise she followed me into the bedroom I stretched out on the bed and felt her sit down I closed my eyes and could tell she was pulling her boots off I heard one boot hit the floor then the other I began to undress on the bed I reached up and shut off the overhead light I continued undressing We kissed some more How long has it been since you ve had a woman Four years Four years Yes I think you deserve some love she said I had a dream about you I opened your chest like a cabinet it had doors and when I opened the doors I saw all kinds of soft things inside you teddy bears tiny fuzzy animals all these soft cuddly things Then I had a dream about this other man He walked up to me and handed me some pieces of paper He was a writer I took the pieces of paper and looked at them And the pieces of paper had cancer His writing had cancer I go by my dreams You deserve some love We kissed again Listen she said after you stick that thing inside me pull it out just before you come O K I understand I climbed on top of her It was good It was something happening something real and with a girl years younger than I was and really after all beautiful I did about strokes and came inside of her She leaped up You son of a bitch You came inside of me Lydia it s been so long it felt so good I couldn t help it It sneaked up on me Honest to Christ I couldn t help it She ran into the bathroom and let the water run into the tub She stood in front of the mirror running a comb through her long brown hair She was truly beautiful You son of a bitch God what a dumb high school trick That s high school shit And it couldn t have happened at a worse time Well we re shackjobs now We re shackjobs now I moved toward her in the bathroom Lydia I love you Get the hell away from me She pushed me out closed the door and I stood out in the hall listening to the bath water run I didn t see Lydia for a couple of days although I did manage to phone her or times during that period Then the weekend arrived Her ex husband Gerald always took the children over the weekend I drove up to her court about am that Saturday morning and knocked She was in tight bluejeans boots orange blouse Her eyes seemed a darker brown than ever and in the sunlight as she opened the door I noticed a natural red in her dark hair It was startling She allowed me to kiss her then she locked the door behind us and we went to my car We had decided on the beach not for bathing it was mid winter but for something to do We drove along It felt good having Lydia in the car with me That was some party she said You call that a collating party That was a copulating party that s what that was A copulating party I drove with one hand and rested the other on her inner thigh I couldn t help myself Lydia didn t seem to notice As I drove along the hand slid down between her legs She went on talking Suddenly she said Take you hand off That s my pussy Sorry I said Neither of us said anything until we reached the parking lot at Venice beach You want a sandwich and a Coke or something I asked All right she said We went into the small Jewish delicatessen to get the things and we took them to a knoll of grass that overlooked the sea We had sandwiches pickles chips and soft drinks The beach was almost deserted and the food tasted fine Lydia was not talking I was amazed at how quickly she ate She ripped into her sandwich with a savagery took large swallows of Coke ate half a pickle in one bite and reached for a handful of potato chips I am on the contrary a very slow eater Passion I thought she has passion How s that sandwich I asked Pretty good I was hungry They make good sandwiches Do you want anything else Yes I d like a candy bar What kind Oh any kind Something good I took a bite of my sandwich a swallow of Coke putthem down and walked over to the store I bought two candy bars so that she might have a choice As I walked back a tall black man was moving toward the knoll It was a chilly day but he had his shirt off and he had a very muscular body He appeared to be in his early twenties He walked very slowly and erect He had a long slim neck and a gold earring hung from the left ear He passed in front of Lydia along the sand on the ocean side of the knoll I came up and sat down beside Lydia Did you see that guy she asked Yes Jesus Christ here I am with you you re twenty years older than I am I could have something like that What the hell s wrong with me Look Here are a couple of candy bars Take one She took one ripped the paper off took a bite and watched the young black man as he walked away along the shore I m tired of the beach she said let s go back to my place We remained apart a week Then one afternoon I was over at Lydia s place and we were on her bed kissing Lydia pulled away You don t know anything about women do you What do you mean I mean I can tell by reading your poems and stories that you just don t know anything about women Tell me more Well I mean for a man to interest me he s got to eat my pussy Have you ever eaten pussy No You re over years old and you ve never eaten pussy No It s too late Why You can t teach an old dog new tricks Sure you can No it s too late for you I ve always been a slow starter Lydia got up and walked into the other room She came back with a pencil and a piece of paper Now look I want to show you something She began to draw on the paper Now this is a cunt and here is something you probably don t know about the clit That s where the feeling is The clit hides you see it comes out now and then it s pink and very sensitive Sometimes it will hide from you and you have to find it you just touch it with the tip of your tongue O K I said I ve got it I don t think you can do it I tell you you can t teach an old dog new tricks Let s take our clothes off and lay down We undressed and stretched out I began kissing Lydia I dropped from the lips to the neck then down to the breasts Then I was down at the bellybutton I moved lower No you can t she said Blood and pee come out of there think of it blood and pee I got down there and began licking She had drawn an accurate picture for me Everything was where it was supposed to be I heard her breathing heavily then moaning It excited me I got a hard on The clit came out but it wasn t exactly pink it was purplish pink I teased the clit Juices appeared and mixed with the cunt hairs Lydia moaned and moaned Then I heard the front door open and close I heard footsteps I looked up A small black boy about years old stood beside the bed What the hell do you want I asked him You got any empty bottles he asked me No I don t have any empty bottles I told him He walked out of the bedroom into the front room out the front door and was gone God said Lydia I thought the front door was locked That was Bonnie s little boy Lydia got up and locked the front door She came back and stretched out It was about pm on a Saturday afternoon I ducked back down Lydia liked parties And Harry was a party giver So we were on our way to Harry Ascot s Harry was the editor of Retort a little magazine His wife wore long see through dresses showed her panties to the men and went barefoot The first thing I liked about you said Lydia was that you didn t have a t v in your place My ex husband looked at t v every night and all through the weekend We even had to arrange our lovemaking to fit the t v schedule Umm Another thing I liked about your place was that it was filthy Beer bottles all over the floor Lots of trash everywhere Dirty dishes and a shit ring in your toilet and the crud in your bathtub All those rusty razorblades laying around the bathroom sink I knew that you would eat pussy You judge a man according to his surroundings right Right When I see a man with a tidy place I know there s something wrong with him And if it s too tidy he s a fag We drove up and got out The apartment was upstairs The music was loud I rang the bell Harry Ascot answered the door He had a gentle and generous smile Come in he said The literary crowd was in there drinking wine and beer talking gathered in clusters Lydia was excited I looked around and sat down Dinner was about to be served Harry was a good fisherman he was a better fisherman than he was a writer and a much better fisherman than he was an editor The Ascots lived on fish while waiting for Harry s talents to start bringing in some money Diana his wife came out with the plates of fish and passed them around Lydia sat next to me Now she said this is how you eat a fish I m a country girl Watch me She opened that fish she did something with her knife to the backbone The fish was in two neat pieces Oh I really liked that said Diana Where did you say you were from Utah Muleshead Utah Population ioo I grew up on a ranch My father was a drunk He s dead now Maybe that s why I m with him She jerked a thumb at me We ate After the fish was consumed Diana carried the bones away Then there was chocolate cake and strong cheap red wine Oh this cake is good said Lydia can I have another piece Sure darling said Diana Mr Chinaski said a dark haired girl from across the room I ve read translations of your books in Germany You re very popular in Germany That s nice I said I wish they d send me some royalties Look said Lydia let s not talk about literary crap Let s do something She leaped up and did a bump and a grind LET S DANCE Harry Ascot put on his gentle and generous smile and walked over and turned up the stereo He turned it up as loud as it would go Lydia danced around the room and a young blond boy with ringlets glued to his forehead joined her They began dancing together Others got up and danced I sat there Randy Evans was sitting next to me I could see he was watching Lydia too He began talking He talked and he talked Thankfully I couldn t hear him the stereo was too loud I watched Lydia dance with the boy with the ringlets Lydia could move it Her movements lurked upon the sexual I looked at the other girls and they didn t seem to be dancing that way but I thought that s only because I know Lydia and I don t know them Randy kept on talking even though I didn t answer The dance ended and Lydia came back and sat down next to me Ooooh I m pooped I think I m out of shape Another record dropped into place and Lydia got up and joined the boy with the golden ringlets I kept drinking beer and wine There were many records Lydia and the boy danced and danced center stage as the others moved around them each dance more intimate than the last I kept drinking the beer and the wine A wild loud dance was in progress The boy with the golden ringlets raised both hands above his head Lydia pressed against him It was dramatic erotic They held their hands high over their heads and pressed their bodies together Body against body He kicked his feet back one at a time Lydia imitated him They stared into each other s eyes I had to admit they were good The record went on and on Finally it ended Lydia came back and sat down next to me I m really pooped she said Look I said I think I ve had too much to drink Maybe we ought to get out of here I ve watched you pouring it down Let s go There ll be other parties We got up to leave Lydia said something to Harry and Diana When she came back we walked toward the door As I opened it the boy with the golden ringlets came up to me Hey man what do you think of me and your girl You re O K When we got outside I began vomiting all the beer and the wine came up It poured and splattered into the brush across the sidewalk a gusher in the moonlight Finally I straightened up and wiped my mouth with my hand That guy worried you didn t he she asked Yes Why It almost seemed like a fuck maybe better It didn t mean anything it was just dancing Suppose that I grabbed a woman on the street like that Would music make it all right You don t understand Each time I finished dancing I came back and sat down next to you O K O K I said wait a minute I puked up another gusher on somebody s dying brush We walked down the hill out of the Echo Park district toward Hollywood Boulevard We got into the car It started and we drove west down Hollywood toward Vermont You know what we call guys like you asked Lydia No We call them she said party poopers We came in low over Kansas City the pilot said the temperature was degrees and there I was in my thin California sports coat and shirt lightweight pants summer stockings and holes in my shoes As we landed and taxied toward the ramp everybody was reaching for overcoats gloves hats mufflers I let them all get off and then climbed down the portable stairway There was Frenchy leaning against a building and waiting Frenchy taught drama and collected books mostly mine Welcome to Kansas Shitty Chinaski he said and handed me a bottle of tequila I took a good gulp and followed him into the parking lot I had no baggage just a portfolio full of poems The car was warm and pleasant and we passed the bottle The roadways were frozen over with ice Not everybody can drive on this fucking kind of ice said Frenchy You got to know what you re doing I opened the portfolio and began reading Frenchy a love poem Lydia had handed me at the airport your purple cock curved like a when I squeeze your pimples
