I'm often fascinated by the randomness and its patterns around us. It's gorgeous. Just look at this picture, generated by percolation simulation

Simulation starts with all the cells closed, then iteratively opens one cell at the time at random. If cell connected to the top - it percolates with water. Simulation stops whenever water reaches the bottom. On average, it takes of cells to be open for the system to percolate. As it percolates, some cells still stay closed.

This picture reminds of the galaxies - why some happened to be suitable for water and atmosphere and some to be so barren? The answer is, probably, - due to the chance. 

Another picture, taken from wiki storage, shows one of the few possible chess board traversal by the knight without visiting the same cell twice.  

Interestingly, you can easily see the patterns, yet you can't easily comprehend the complex structure of the puzzle.
